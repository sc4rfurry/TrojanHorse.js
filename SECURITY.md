- **PBKDF2**: Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 with high iteration counts
- **SHA-256**: Secure Hash Algorithm for integrity verification
- **HMAC-SHA256**: Hash-based Message Authentication Code for data authentication
- **TLS 1.3**: Minimum encryption for all network communications

### Enterprise Security Controls
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Request Signing**: HMAC signatures for API request authenticity
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Prevention of injection attacks
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery prevention
- **XSS Prevention**: Cross-Site Scripting mitigation

## üîç Security Assessments

### Automated Security Testing

- **Low** (0.1-3.9 CVSS): Recognition and swag

### Qualifying Vulnerabilities
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation
- Data exposure or leakage
- Cryptographic flaws
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

### Out of Scope
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Denial of service (DoS/DDoS)
- Issues in third-party dependencies
- Rate limiting bypass
- Self-XSS vulnerabilities
- Issues requiring physical access to devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Users

### API Key Management
```javascript
// ‚úÖ DO - Use environment variables
const apiKeys = {
  alienVault: process.env.TROJANHORSE_ALIENVAULT_KEY,
  crowdsec: process.env.TROJANHORSE_CROWDSEC_KEY
};

// ‚ùå DON'T - Hardcode API keys
const apiKeys = {
  alienVault: 'your-api-key-here', // Never do this!
};
```

### Secure Configuration
```javascript
// ‚úÖ DO - Use maximum security settings
const trojan = new TrojanHorse({
  security: {
    mode: 'fort-knox',
    httpsOnly: true,
    certificatePinning: true,
    minTlsVersion: '1.3'
  },
  vault: {
    autoLock: true,
    lockTimeout: 300000, // 5 minutes
    iterations: 100000 // High iteration count
  }
});
```

### Network Security
```javascript
// ‚úÖ DO - Validate SSL certificates
const trojan = new TrojanHorse({
  security: {
    validateCertificates: true,
    certificatePinning: true,
    httpsOnly: true
  }
});
```

### Data Handling
```javascript
// ‚úÖ DO - Enable audit logging
const trojan = new TrojanHorse({
  audit: {
    enabled: true,
    logLevel: 'info',
    piiMasking: true,
    encryptLogs: true
  }
});
```
